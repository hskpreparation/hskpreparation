It's impossible to fathom exactly what you need to do to gain face, or indeed to avoid losing it. When I got to China, I was surprised at the way some men seemed happy and indeed obliged to carry their partner's handbag around. I thought it illustrated a clear 丢脸（loss of face）. I've discussed this with different Chinese people and got mixed responses. Some say it makes the man look good and he gains face by being the "good boyfriend," and some say the man loses face by looking weak and subservient. Like most things in China, it's interesting to find out about, but you are fighting a losing battle if you intend to totally understand it. konw more hsk preparation
