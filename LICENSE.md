  It's impossible  to fathom exactly what you need to do to gain face, or indeed to avoid losing  it. When I got to China, I was surprised at the way some men seemed happy and  indeed obliged to carry their partner's handbag around. I thought it  illustrated a clear 丢脸（loss of face）. I've discussed this with different Chinese people and got mixed  responses. Some say it makes the man look good and he gains face by being the  &quot;good boyfriend,&quot; and some say the man loses face by looking weak and  subservient. Like most things in China, it's interesting to find out about, but  you are fighting a losing battle if you intend to totally understand it. konw  more <a href="http://sina.echineselearning.com/english/adult-chinese/hsk-test-preparation.html">hsk  preparation </a> </p>
